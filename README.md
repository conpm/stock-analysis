### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to perform an analysis on a variety of green stocks in order to determine how the stocks have performed over 2017 & 2018 searching for two major criteria.  The first was the total of daily trading volume and the second was the percentage return on the stock over the course of the year.  This analysis can then be used in order to advise on current investments as well as to guide potential future investments.
